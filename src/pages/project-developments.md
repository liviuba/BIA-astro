### BioImaging Project

EMBL has been supported via the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Strategic Project Fund to develop the internal infrastructure and image resources hosted at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).

### BioImaging Project Governance
The BioImaging Project is one project supporting the wider Data Infrastructure Programme. It will follow the below governance model with [UKRI-BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/) taking on the external Senior Responsible owner role for the capital investment and EMBL-EBI taking on Internal Sponsorship to provide the operational investment required to successfully deliver the project.

### Community engagement

Working with community experts throughout the development process is paramount to ensure that the BioImage Archive serves the needs of life-science researchers, data scientists, software engineers, funders and the wider public.

Developing the technical and biological metadata required for successful image-data submission, as well as the best methods to store, link and serve image data to enable wider image re-use, is one of the first, essential steps in making the BioImage Archive a reality. For this purpose, specialists from EMBL-EBI and colleagues over 30 other institutions have compiled a series of metadata guidelines called Recommended Metadata for Biological Images (REMBI). These were published in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01166-8">comment in Nature Methods</a> on 21st May 2021. The standard has been adopted by the BioImage Archive.

The guidelines are a result of a series of meetings with representatives from the different bioimaging communities, including light, electron and X-ray microscopy communities. The aim of the proposed guidelines is to provide a framework for discussing imaging data sharing. The hope is to reach community-wide consensus on the level of detail that is optimal.

The current version of REMBI is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ck1NeLp-ZN4eMGdNYo2nV6KLEdSfN6oQBKnnWU6Npeo/edit#gid=1023506919">online</a>


### Funders

Ongoing development is enabled by capital investment from the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund and operational costs
supported by EMBL member state funding.
