## How to contribute to the Galleries


Galleries is a new addition to the BioImage Archive website. It provides a different presentation of the datasets 
in the archive where you can visualise the images on-the-fly.  

There are more galleries due to be added to the Galleries page. We will also keep adding more datasets to the existing galleries. 
Please <a href="mailto:bioimage-archive@ebi.ac.uk">contact us</a> if there is a dataset you would like to be added to one of the galleries. 
This may be a submission that is already in the BioImage Archive, or a dataset that you'd like to submit, or a public 
dataset elsewhere which you think would benefit from the visualisation features in our Galleries.
