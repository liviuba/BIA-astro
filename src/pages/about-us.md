BioImage Archive is the first central open data imaging archive to support the growing imaging communities and the specialised data resources they may need.

### Objectives
- **Promote** open imaging data and reproducibility of analyses. This allows authors to provide a complete record of their original data and analysis methods, and enables other interested scientists to explore alternative analyses of the same raw data.
- **Provide** reference data for the research community. These data, along with rules of community use and analysis methods, avoid the redundant production of replica datasets and can be the basis for added-value resources (e.g., atlases). They will provide a large efficiency gain for routine experiments and, over time, build a comprehensive scientific reference image resource for cells, tissues, organs, and organisms.
- **Allow** new scientific discoveries to be made using existing data, via novel or integrated analysis of datasets that were originally generated for a different purpose.
- **Accelerate** the development of image analysis methods against a broad range of benchmark datasets, thus encouraging validation and robustness of the computational methods and enabling well-structured image analysis challenges.
