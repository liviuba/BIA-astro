## Submitting data to the BioImage Archive

Submission to the BioImage Archive currently uses the BioStudies submission system. Before submission you can check whether your data are in scope [here](/scope).

To submit, you'll need to **register an account**, **organise and upload your data**, **prepare a file list**, and then **submit** using our web submission form. These steps are explained in more detail below.

**NEW:** You can now submit annotations, i.e. segmentation masks, meshes etc., with or without including the source images. [For annotations only submission instructions please click here.](/submitannotations)

### 1. Register an account

You will need to register for a BioStudies account. You can sign up [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/submissions/#/signup) and then return to this guide.

### 2. Prepare your data

Now, organise your data for submission. Please include everything needed to reproduce your results. This might be raw data, intermediate results or processed data like composite images or segmentation masks etc. Your data files should be in a single directory tree with a logical hierarchical file structure. Please note that the file paths are not visible on the submission web page, therefore if there is embedded information in the directory structure please put that information as metadata in the file list (see step 4).

Please note that some special characters are not allowed in directory and file names. Stick to the allowed characters listed [here](/helpfilelist/#namerules) to avoid any problems with your submission. 

For any program code accompanying your study, it is best to upload that code to a specialised repository (e.g. GitHub or Gitlab), and then add a link to it in your submission, which you will be able to do during the submission process.  

The BioImage Archive implemented  Recommended Metadata for Biological Images (REMBI) metadata guidelines
to further support FAIR sharing. You will need to provide REMBI level metadata of your study at the final
step of the submission process, using the BIA web submission tool. REMBI guidelines are also useful to
plan on what to include and how to organise your data. Please check the more detailed overview of
[REMBI metadata here](/rembi-help-overview) and how to organise your submission into
[REMBI Study Components](/rembi-help-examples/).

### 3. Upload your data

We support multiple methods of data upload, each recommended if the submission size falls within one of the following ranges:

| Submission size | Recommended upload method |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| If less than 50GB total size and <br/> Less than 20GB per individual file   | [Submission tool upload](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/submissions/files)    |
| If up to 1TB total size        | FTP                       |
| If larger than 1TB     | Aspera     

The FTP/Aspera tab in the [submission tool upload section](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/submissions/files) will include your credentials and upload guidance for these two upload methods.

### 4. Prepare your file list

<img src={fileListImage.src} alt="File List" style="height: 120px; float: right;"/>

You will need a "table of contents" for your image files, called a "File List" in the submission tool. 
If you have annotations, e.g. segmentations masks, point annotations etc., you need a separate file list for them. The purpose of this file is to provide information about the individual image files that will help the users of your dataset understand what different files mean and specify file level metadata. It can be a tab delimited file (in which case file extension should be ".tsv"), or an Excel file (".xls" or ".xlsx"). 

Please read the **[File List help page](/helpfilelist)** and then return to this guide.


### 5. Submission

When all image files and one or more file lists have been uploaded, you can create your submission
[here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/submissions/new;template=bioimages). **Make sure you select the BioImages template when creating a new submission**.

Fill in all the necessary
fields in the web forms that will be offered. You can also add sections to your submission if necessary.
Make sure that the validation panel on the left indicates "all ok". When that is the case, click on
"Submit". For detailed guidance on how to fill the submission form, how to add sections and edit your
submission, please check the [Submission subsection](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/bioimage-archive-quick-tour/submitting-data-to-resource-name/submission/)
of BIA online tutorial. 

After your submission is loaded into the BioStudies database, it will be assigned a unique BioImage
Archive accession number (i.e., dataset identifier); details on how to access and share your study
with others will be available in a confirmation window and will also be sent via e-mail. Your submission
will however only be visible to you until its 'Release Date'.
