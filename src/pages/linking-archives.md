If you have data or analysis code that are deposited to other repositories, you can easily link them in your submission.

A common use case is correlative datasets with volume electron micsroscopy data deposited to EMPIAR or spatial-omics datasets. For spatial-omics datasets, spatial data (i.e. images, segmentations etc.) are deposited to the BioImage Archive, while the corresponding omics data is deposited in relevant omics repositories. These datasets can then be linked to one another (see the short demo below).
