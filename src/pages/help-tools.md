#### Metadata

Metadata extraction software:

* [Micro-Meta App: an interactive tool for collecting microscopy metadata based on community specifications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01315-z) Documentation and download [here](https://micrometaapp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/about.html)

* [MethodsJ2: a software tool to capture metadata and generate comprehensive microscopy methods text](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01290-5) Documentation and download [here](https://github.com/ABIF-McGill/MethodsJ2)

* [MDEmic: a metadata annotation tool to facilitate management of FAIR image data in the bioimaging community](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01288-z)

#### Data Analysis

[Bia-binder](https://binder.bioimagearchive.org/): Run Jupyter Notebooks and experiment directly on the BioImageArchive

#### Organisations

[EuroBioimaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/)

[QUAREP-LiMi](https://quarep.org/): Quality Assessment and Reproducibility for Instruments & Images in Light Microscopy

[Global BioImaging](https://globalbioimaging.org/)

In the future, capabilities will be available to connect other added-value resources that aim to enhance the scientific value of the archived images through curation, integrative analysis and the development of new analytical methods.
